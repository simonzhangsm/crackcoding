\section{ReverseBit}
reverse binary bit pattern for an integer without using any string or utility methods

\section{Even Number Present}
You have an array of integers(size N), such that each integer is present an odd number of time, except 3 of them(which are present even number of times). Find the three numbers. Only XOR based solution was permitted.
Time Complexity: O(N);
Space Complexity: O(1).

Sample Input:
{1,6,4,1,4,5,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,7,9,5,9}
Sample Output:
1 6 8

\section{Find Odd-present Numbers}
Array of Integers with even number of same Integers. Find the Integer that is an odd number of times. Compare efficiency between different approaches.
