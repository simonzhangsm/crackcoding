Difference between http get and post request？


GET and POST are two different types of HTTP requests.

【GET】Grequests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web 
applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause.

【POST】Psubmits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new 
resource or the updates of existing resources or both.

So essentially GET is used to retrieve remote data, and POST is used to insert/update remote data.
